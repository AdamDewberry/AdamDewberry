## Hello there

Adam here.

I'm big into a GitOps & DevOps approach to data.

I specialise in building modern, scalable data platforms - whether that be migrating from legacy systems to the cloud or starting with a blank slate on a green field project. Checkout some of the open source work I maintain on [Terraforming Snowflake](https://github.com/infinityworks/snow-cannon) with [Infinity Works](https://infinityworks.com/).

Knowledge sharing and teaching are important to me; I believe anyone can learn to code, they just need the right guidance and framework. I started the [Data Engineering 101](https://dewberry.dev/) project as a pathway for newcomers to learn enough to get a first job as a data engineer, with Python and SQL. The project is ongoing and I currently have a number of students piloting the course.
